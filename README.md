# C-Piscine-42-M-laga-Jun-2024
My progress during the C Piscine on 42 MÃ¡laga.
With this, I passed straight into the cursus. I hope this helps you!


SPOILERS AHEAD: Some details to keep in mind:

Every weekend, a "Rush" is made, where you along with other 2 human beings (hopefully) will take on a VERY HARD assigment. This outclasses everything you know at that point, and the sole purpose of it its basically you trying to make it work and fail miserably with a 0 anyways. Make it your goal to learn on rushes, not taking any reference on the internet.

Exams wont do much, try to do one or two assigments on them every week, the more the better, but in the end I dont think they really matter.

In my piscine, most people who passed into the cursus did both Shell projects and up to C 03 - C 06, so, try to reach there

Please take my notes as references, do not copy them directly, you will just be embarrased trying to explain them to other people.
