# C Piscine | 42 Málaga | June 2024

Welcome to my progress log for the C Piscine at 42 Málaga! 🎉 Passing this intensive program allowed me to move straight into the **cursus**, and I hope sharing my experience here will be useful to you.

## 🚨 SPOILERS AHEAD: Important Tips and Insights

### 🌟 Weekend "Rush" Challenges
Every weekend, you'll face a **"Rush"** — an extremely challenging assignment that will push your skills to their limits. Here’s what you need to know:
- **Objective**: Complete a daunting task with minimal guidance and **prepare for failure**.
- **Strategy**: Focus on learning during these rushes rather than finding solutions online. It's all about the experience!

### 📚 Exams and Assignments
Exams might seem daunting, but:
- **Pushing**: Aim to at least not send them empty, 1 or 2 assignments done would be enough.
- **Importance**: While exams are valuable, the assignments you complete are more crucial to your learning and progression (and passing the piscine as well!).

### 📈 Project Progression
From my experience, most successful candidates in the piscine:
- **Completed**: Both Shell projects and up to **C 03 - C 06**.
- **Recommendation**: Strive to reach at least this level to enhance your chances of advancing.
- **Conduct**: Candidates on my piscine who passed to the cursus spent the whole day speaking to others, working as a team, and doing evaluations.

### 💡 Key Takeaways
- **BSQ**: It’s okay to prioritize other projects over BSQ if needed.
- **Learning Mindset**: Embrace failures as learning opportunities. The goal is to absorb as much knowledge as possible within your available time.

### ⚠️ A Final Note
Feel free to use my notes as **reference material**, but **avoid copying them directly**. It's better to understand the concepts so you can explain them confidently to others.

Good luck, and may your piscine journey be both challenging and rewarding! 🚀
